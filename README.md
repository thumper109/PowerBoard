# PowerBoard
4 Way power board crontrolled using an ESP8266 via mqtt.

A project inspired by the InfernoEmbeddeds esp-workshop https://github.com/InfernoEmbedded/esp-workshop I have put together this little first go at open hardware.

It uses an ESP8266 Mini D1 and a cheap 4 channel Relay module source from ebay. Using NodeMCU to program the D1 module, mqtt to a mosquitto server, Node-Red to program the flow of the messages and a simple html file to interact.

I have also started program a python tool to also interact. 

NOTE: This is no where near a finished product and I have put it up here so people can see simple expamples of the different aspects. Please fee free to use anything you find here thats useful. 

Also feel free to make suggestions as all of this (inculding git) is new to me, and help is always welcomed.
