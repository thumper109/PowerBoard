# PowerBoard
4 Way power board crontrolled using an ESP8266 via mqtt.

A project inspired by the InfernoEmbeddeds esp-workshop https://github.com/InfernoEmbedded/esp-workshop I have put together this little first go at open hardware.

It uses an ESP8266 Mini D1 and a cheap 4 channel Relay module source from ebay. Using NodeMCU to program the D1 module, mqtt to a mosquitto serve, Node-Red to program the flow of the messages and a simple html file to interact.

I have also started program a python tool to also interact. 

NOTE: this is no where near a finished product and I have put it up here so people can see simple expamples of the different aspect. Please cut and paste if you find useful bits. Also please make suggestions as all of this in new to me, and help is always welcomed.
